Understanding how genetic risk variants contribute to Alzheimer’s Disease etiology remains a challenge. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) allows for the investigation of cell type specific effects of genomic risk loci on gene expression. Using seven scRNAseq datasets totalling >1.3 million cells, we investigated differential correlation of genes between healthy individuals and individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease. Using the number of differential correlations of a gene to estimate its involvement and potential impact, we present a prioritization scheme for identifying probable causal genes near genomic risk loci. Besides prioritizing genes, our approach pin-points specific cell types and provides insight into the rewiring of gene-gene relationships associated with Alzheimer’s.
